Karen and Brenda built a unique program that put parents in charge of helping their child meet developmental challenges, with support and education from each other and caring professionals!</p>\n','pexels-photo-1109238.jpg','right'),(2,'1986','Early Intervention services begin.','<p>In August 1986, Karen and Brenda took their vision to a new level by winning a state grant to provide comprehensive Early Intervention services to children with a variety of delays and disabilities. As a result, Kids On The Move, Inc. was incorporated as a nonprofit organization. The name was chosen to highlight the positive expectations the community should have of kids with special needs &mdash; that they have the potential to continuously grow and learn.</p>\n','IMG_9612.jpg','left'),(3,'1992','A new home.','<p>In the early years, the organization lived up to its name by being &ldquo;on the move&rdquo; as it occupied the old Spencer School in Orem then moved temporarily to the old &ldquo;Tech School&rdquo; campus in Provo. In 1990, an open community meeting led to an unprecedented capital campaign to build a permanent location for Kids On The Move. This successful campaign led to the 1992 completion of a new building in Orem on the campus of Intermountain Healthcare&rsquo;s Orem Community Hospital. At that time, Kids On The Move served about 50 families with a staff of six.</p>\n','ben-konfrst-1152805-unsplash.jpg','right'),(4,'1998','Early Head Start is added.','<p>In 1998, Kids On The Move received a competitive grant from the federal government to provide Early Head Start services to Utah County. The Early Head Start program is designed for first-time pregnant women and children under age 3 who live in poverty. From 1999 to 2009, Kids On the Move received funding to serve only 64 children in poverty in Utah County. However, in November 2009 the program was expanded to serve 164 children county wide. With this expansion, Early Head Start was able to offer center-based services to 32 children, and a full home-based program to 132 children throughout the county.</p>','2021-02-09-11-49-pexels-filipe-leme-2760338.jpg','left'),(5,'2006','Library expansion begins.','<p>Consistent with its philosophy that parents had a right to extensive information to help their children, from its earliest days Kids On the Move had a parent library, however modest. This important part of Kids On the Move has grown to a fully operational library that was re-dedicated in July 2006 as the Noorda Family Resource Center. In order to make services more accessible to the growing number of families residing in newly incorporated Eagle Mountain and a quickly developing Saratoga Springs, a satellite center in was completed on the site of Snow Springs Elementary School in western Lehi in November 2008.</p>','IMG_9906.jpg','right'),(7,'1992','Child Care services begin.','<p>Not long after occupying the new building, Kids On the Move began a small Child Care program for 12 children, primarily to provide care to siblings of children coming to the center for services. The Child Care program became a fully licensed Child Care center and expanded over the years to our current 45 child capacity. In addition to serving children enrolled in KOTM developmental services, there is room to provide child care for some community and staff children. Child Care has provided a model of quality care in our community at competitive rates.</p>\n','_DSC0744-10.jpg',NULL),(11,'2010','Autism Center is developed.','<p>In response to an explosion in the number of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Kids On the Move created a new program to serve children ages 3&nbsp;and up&nbsp;with ASD&nbsp;or similar disorders. Unlike other child development programs at Kids On the Move, this program is not backed by government funding. Based on ABA best practices, the Autism Center was developed to offer families flexible, affordable, effective services that help families get the support and education they need.</p>\n','2021-02-25-22-08-vitaliy-zalishchyker-mFNXVrFkT70-unsplash.jpg',NULL),(14,'2004','Building expansion.','<p>The rapid growth in population in Utah County led to a swift expansion of services and the number of families served annually. By 2002, Kids On the Move had grown to an average monthly enrollment of about 500 children served by 65 staff. The organization was bursting at the seams! Another successful capital campaign garnered support from individuals, businesses, foundations, and local governments. In September 2003, a newly expanded building was dedicated.</p>\n','orem.jpg',NULL),(15,'2016','Respite Care begins.','<p>Friday&rsquo;s Kids Respite, a sister organization which had operated out of the KOTM building since 2000, was dissolved in July 2016. Kids On The Move added respite services as its fourth core program, maintaining the organizational structure of Friday&rsquo;s Kids. This program is supported by private funding and grants. Respite Care offers a safe, supervised, fun environment for children with one-on-one supervision. Most importantly, it provides parents of children with special needs the short periods of rest they need to relieve stress, renew energy, and restore balance.</p>\n','respite.jpg',NULL);

Our BCBAs (Board Certified Behavioral Analysts) have masters&rsquo; level experience and knowledge in training caregivers and working with children.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that all families should have access to the best care for their children. Thanks to our online delivery system, families have immediate access to ABA therapy, eliminating the delays caused by wait-lists, scheduling or geographical location.</p>\n\n<h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4>\n\n<p>Many years of research has been done to find the best way to aid in the physical and mental development of children on the autism spectrum; and Applied Behavior Analysis therapy has continuously been found to be the most effective by taking a look at how human beings learn new things. Additional research has shown that ABA therapy can be is just as effective through telehealth technology as it is in home. &nbsp;in-home as it is through telehealth technology.</p>\n\n<p>To make it all happen our clinicians are equipped with technology that allows for live video and audio streaming as well as data collection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some rural locations throughout the state of Utah have well-trained behavior therapist who will carry out the treatment goals during 1:1 therapy in your home, just as our behavior therapists do in a traditional in-home model. &nbsp;The child&rsquo;s BCBA will video conference with the behavior technician during their session so they can oversee the therapy, see the chlid&rsquo;s progress, and make changes to treatment accordingly. The BCBA will also meet with the parent over video conference to provide parent training and to collaborate on goals.&nbsp;<br />\nFor areas in Utah where we do not have local behavior therapists, we are able to offer families an individualized parent training model. &nbsp;The BCBA will train the child&rsquo;s parent to implement ABA therapy techniques, and take data on their child&rsquo;s progress. The BCBA provides the same level of weekly support and training through live video conferencing with the parent, just as we would with our many behavior therapists who implement therapy for our clients in other parts of the state. &nbsp;Dedicated parents who participate in this model are able to become skilled in providing this vital service for their child, with ongoing guidance from a BCBA.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?</h4>\n\n<p>We always ensure that the parents and caregivers are a part of all treatment sessions where they can learn ABA strategies that can further their child&rsquo;s overall progress in obtaining behavioral goals.&nbsp;<strong>To find out more about these resources in your area, please apply.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"youtube-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASVPwNzit0U\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n','pexels-photo-3818963.jpg','article-image-right',3,'https://members.centralreach.com/?public=true#forms/form?id=29127158-0D8A-44A7-B93A-C8F6242A9CBD','Apply for ABA Therapy'),(17,'Assessment',1,'<p>One of our first steps in designing effective treatment for your child involves an assessment.

The BCBA will also meet with the parent over video conference to provide parent training and to collaborate on goals.&nbsp;<br />\\nFor areas in Utah where we do not have local behavior therapists, we are able to offer families an individualized parent training model. &nbsp;The BCBA will train the child&rsquo;s parent to implement ABA therapy techniques, and take data on their child&rsquo;s progress. The BCBA provides the same level of weekly support and training through live video conferencing with the parent, just as we would with our many behavior therapists who implement therapy for our clients in other parts of the state. &nbsp;Dedicated parents who participate in this model are able to become skilled in providing this vital service for their child, with ongoing guidance from a BCBA.<br />\\n&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h4>HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?</h4>\\n\\n<p>We always ensure that the parents and caregivers are a part of all treatment sessions where they can learn ABA strategies that can further their child&rsquo;s overall progress in obtaining behavioral goals.&nbsp;<strong>To find out more about these resources in your area, please apply.&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"youtube-embed-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\\\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASVPwNzit0U\\\" style=\\\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\\\" width=\\\"640\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"pexels-photo-3818963.jpg\",\"imagePosition\":\"article-image-right\",\"sectionOrder\":3,\"buttonLink\":\"https://members.centralreach.com/?public=true#forms/form?id=29127158-0D8A-44A7-B93A-C8F6242A9CBD\",\"buttonText\":\"Apply for ABA Therapy\"},{\"id\":15,\"title\":\"\",\"text\":\"<p>We are expanding access to ABA therapy through the use of&nbsp;telehealth technology&nbsp;to close the gap between individuals with autism obtaining this much needed therapy and their geographical location.&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"image\":null,\"imagePosition\":null,\"sectionOrder\":1,\"buttonLink\":null,\"buttonText\":null}]},{\"id\":2,\"title\":\"Teen Social Skills (PEERS)\",\"tabOrder\":2,\"link\":null,\"slug\":\"teen-social-skills-(peers)\",\"sections\":[{\"id\":48,\"title\":\"More Information\",\"text\":\"<p>PEERS originally started at UCLA and had a high proven success rate.

The BCBA will also meet with the parent over video conference to provide parent training and to collaborate on goals.&nbsp;<br />\\nFor areas in Utah where we do not have local behavior therapists, we are able to offer families an individualized parent training model. &nbsp;The BCBA will train the child&rsquo;s parent to implement ABA therapy techniques, and take data on their child&rsquo;s progress. The BCBA provides the same level of weekly support and training through live video conferencing with the parent, just as we would with our many behavior therapists who implement therapy for our clients in other parts of the state. &nbsp;Dedicated parents who participate in this model are able to become skilled in providing this vital service for their child, with ongoing guidance from a BCBA.<br />\\n&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h4>HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?</h4>\\n\\n<p>We always ensure that the parents and caregivers are a part of all treatment sessions where they can learn ABA strategies that can further their child&rsquo;s overall progress in obtaining behavioral goals.&nbsp;<strong>To find out more about these resources in your area, please apply.&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"youtube-embed-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\\\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASVPwNzit0U\\\" style=\\\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\\\" width=\\\"640\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"pexels-photo-3818963.jpg\",\"imagePosition\":\"article-image-right\",\"sectionOrder\":3,\"buttonLink\":\"https://members.centralreach.com/?public=true#forms/form?id=29127158-0D8A-44A7-B93A-C8F6242A9CBD\",\"buttonText\":\"Apply for ABA Therapy\"},{\"id\":15,\"title\":\"\",\"text\":\"<p>We are expanding access to ABA therapy through the use of&nbsp;telehealth technology&nbsp;to close the gap between individuals with autism obtaining this much needed therapy and their geographical location.&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"image\":null,\"imagePosition\":null,\"sectionOrder\":1,\"buttonLink\":null,\"buttonText\":null}]},{\"id\":2,\"title\":\"Teen Social Skills (PEERS)\",\"tabOrder\":2,\"link\":null,\"slug\":\"teen-social-skills-(peers)\",\"sections\":[{\"id\":48,\"title\":\"More Information\",\"text\":\"<p>PEERS originally started at UCLA and had a high proven success rate.
